# NLP: Deep Learning with PyTorch Tensor Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn the following:
- Utilizing PyTorch tensors to encode inputs, outputs, and parameters for deep learning models.

## Recommended Preparation

Before starting this tutorial it is recommended that you have installed [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index), and have a basic understanding of [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/doc/):

### Google Colab

For tips on running tutorial notebooks in Google Colab, see [Colab Pytorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/colab)

### Conda Environment Setup

Use the first command to create new independent environment for the project. Or use the other two commands to remove or update the Conda environment.

```shell
# To create a conda environment.
conda env create -f environment.yml

# To remove a conda environment.
conda remove --name dl --all

# To update a conda environment when some new libraries are added.
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```
Then, install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
